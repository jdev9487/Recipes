# Lemon Drizzle

## Ingredients

### Cake:
320g plain flour
250g caster sugar
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp baking powder
½ tsp salt
350ml plant based milk
120ml olive or vegetable oil
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 tsp lemon zest
2 tbsp lemon extract or lemon juice

### Lemon Glaze:
5 tbsp lemon juice
2 tbsp caster sugar

### Lemon Icing:
80g icing sugar
1 tbsp lemon juice

## Method

STEP 1
Preheat the oven to 180˚C.

STEP 2
Start by making the cake. Sift flour into a large bowl. Add white sugar, baking soda, baking powder and salt and mix to combine. In a separate bowl, combine milk, olive oil, apple cider vinegar, vanilla extract, lemon zest and lemon juice and whisk to combine.

STEP 3
Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, and fold to incorporate. Grease and line a baking tray (ours was 33x23) with parchment paper.

STEP 4
Pour the cake batter in and transfer to the middle shelf of your oven. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. (Note: If you’re using a taller baking dish, the cake might take an extra 10-15 minutes to bake, as the tin will be deeper).

STEP 5
Next make the glaze. In a small bowl whisk together 5 tbsp of lemon juice and 3 tbsp caster sugar and stir until the sugar dissolves.

STEP 6
Once the cake is baked, brush the glaze over it while it's still warm. Remove it from the tin, then let it cool completely.

STEP 7
While the cake cools, prepare the icing. In a bowl, whisk the icing sugar and lemon juice together. The mixture should be easily spreadable and runny, but not liquid. If it’s too thick, add an extra drop of lemon juice, and if too thin, add an extra tsp of icing sugar.

STEP 8
Once the cake has completely cooled, drizzle the icing onto it. Let the cake sit for 10 minutes, where the icing with set and harden.
